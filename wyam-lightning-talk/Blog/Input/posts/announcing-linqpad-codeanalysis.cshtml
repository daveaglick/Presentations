<p>LINQPad.CodeAnalysis is a library that contains a set of .NET Compiler Platform helpers and utilities for LINQPad. Because it is so low ceremony but also has advanced functionality like debugging, data source connections, and advanced output and visualization, LINQPad provides an ideal platform for quickly experimenting, exploring, and working with the .NET Compiler Platform.</p>

<p>The first feature (of what I plan to be many) is a syntax tree visualizer similar to the one available for Visual Studio 2015. It allows you to dump a syntax tree for your current query, other queries, or generated directly via the .NET Compiler Platform.</p>
