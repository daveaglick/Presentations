# Intro

This repository contains presentations, sample code, etc. I often give the same talk more than once, so I tend to iterate on them each time. If you want to see what the slides, code, etc. looked like on a particular date, use the repository history.

# Usage

Most of my recent presentations have used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) so they can be viewed in a web browser. I recommend using [dotnet-serve](https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-serve). Install it as a global tool and serve the root of this presentations repository:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-serve
dotnet serve -o
```
